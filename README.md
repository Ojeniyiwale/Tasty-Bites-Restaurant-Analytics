In the fast-growing food delivery market, understanding what drives success is key. This project analyzes 21,321 food delivery orders from six Tasty Bites Restaurant locations to uncover consumer behavior trends, delivery challenges, and business insights that can guide strategic decisions for restaurants and platforms alike.
📁 Dataset Overview
Source: Tasty Bites Restaurant delivery logs
Records: 21,321 food delivery orders
Restaurants: 6 different Tasty Bites locations
Features include:

Restaurant location info (city, subzone)

Order timestamps and statuses

Delivery time & distance

Pricing (subtotal, packaging, discounts)

Customer ratings and reviews

Rider wait and food prep times

🔍 Methodology
Cleaned and structured data using spreadsheet functions (pivot tables, filtering)

Aggregated statistics by location, distance, discounts, and delivery time

Calculated error rates, cancellation frequencies, and rider wait patterns

Visual trends derived via charts (not shown here but intended for inclusion in analysis notebooks)

📌 Key Insights
1. Winner-Takes-Most Dynamics
Aura Pizzas: 65% of orders (14,548) and 72% of revenue ($10.75M)

Swaad: 28% of orders and 24% of revenue

Remaining 4 locations combined < 4% of market share

🧠 Implication: Food delivery success is highly concentrated — new locations must be laser-focused in strategy.

2. Operational Paradox of Success
High-volume restaurants had more cancellations (e.g., Aura Pizzas: 37)

14% of orders had rider wait times > 10 minutes

10% error rate in deliveries (missed/incorrect items)

⚠️ Insight: Scaling volume often degrades efficiency if systems aren’t upgraded.

3. Distance vs. Demand
80% of deliveries occur within 1–7km

Drop beyond 7km — but anomaly at 9km (767 orders > 8km's 709)

📦 Opportunity: Tap into overlooked zones like 8–10km with better targeting or promos.

4. The Discount Dilemma
Discounts >10% → 20% more orders but ~5% margin loss

5–10% = optimal balance of volume and margin

💰 Takeaway: Avoid blanket discounting. Use targeted offers instead.

🚀 Strategic Recommendations
For Restaurant Owners
Scale with caution — invest in kitchen automation & workflow efficiency

Geo-target within 7km for max ROI

Audit menus of low-performing branches for pricing/popularity

For Delivery Platforms
Reduce 10% error rate via training & verification systems

Implement dynamic rider allocation for demand hot zones

Real-time delay alerts can reduce cancellations and bad reviews

For Investors & Analysts
Market share is dangerously top-heavy — opportunity for efficient challengers

Ghost kitchen models might outperform low-footfall outlets

🧭 Action Plans by Segment
Stakeholder	Recommendation
Market Leaders	Focus on reducing cancellations, not expansion
Offer loyalty programs and prep scheduling
Challengers	Use partnerships and niche targeting (e.g., long-distance)
Differentiate on service reliability
New Entrants	Build from day one for delivery precision
Target 8–10km zones and subscription models

📈 The Road Ahead: Future Analytics Opportunities
Predictive Modeling: Anticipate peak orders and delays

Route Optimization: Integrate GPS data for real-time planning

Customer Segmentation: Personalized promos by location or behavior

Sustainability Tracking: Monitor packaging waste & carbon impact

✅ Conclusion: Data as a Differentiator
Success in food delivery isn’t just about good food — it’s about data-driven operations. This analysis shows that:

Market leaders face operational strain as they scale

Distance and discount patterns reveal overlooked opportunities

Customer experience is vulnerable to errors, delays, and inefficiencies

🔑 Winning in this market means mastering data, not just menus.
